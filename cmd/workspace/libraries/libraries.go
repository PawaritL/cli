  status of libraries on a cluster.
  
  To make third-party or custom code available to notebooks and jobs running on
  your clusters, you can install a library. Libraries can be written in Python,
  Java, Scala, and R. You can upload Java, Scala, and Python libraries and point
  to external packages in PyPI, Maven, and CRAN repositories.
  
  Cluster libraries can be used by all notebooks running on a cluster. You can
  install a cluster library directly from a public repository such as PyPI or
  Maven, using a previously installed workspace library, or using an init
  script.
  
  When you install a library on a cluster, a notebook already attached to that
  cluster will not immediately see the new library. You must first detach and
  then reattach the notebook to the cluster.
  
  When you uninstall a library from a cluster, the library is removed only when
  you restart the cluster. Until you restart the cluster, the status of the
  uninstalled library appears as Uninstall pending restart.`,
