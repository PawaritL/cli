## `bricks alerts` - The alerts API can be used to perform CRUD operations on alerts.

The alerts API can be used to perform CRUD operations on alerts. An alert is a Databricks SQL
object that periodically runs a query, evaluates a condition of its result, and notifies one
or more users and/or notification destinations if the condition was met.

### `bricks alerts create` - Create an alert.

An alert is a Databricks SQL object that periodically runs a query, evaluates a condition of its result,
and notifies users or notification destinations if the condition was met.

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body * `--parent` - The identifier of the workspace folder containing the alert.
 * `--rearm` - Number of seconds after being triggered before the alert rearms itself and can be triggered again.

### `bricks alerts delete` - Delete an alert.

Deletes an alert. Deleted alerts are no longer accessible and cannot be restored.
**Note:** Unlike queries and dashboards, alerts cannot be moved to the trash.

### `bricks alerts get` - Get an alert.

Gets an alert.

### `bricks alerts list` - Get alerts.

Gets a list of alerts.

### `bricks alerts update` - Update an alert.

Updates an alert.

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body
 * `--rearm` - Number of seconds after being triggered before the alert rearms itself and can be triggered again.

## `bricks catalogs` - A catalog is the first layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level namespace.

A catalog is the first layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level namespace. Itâ€™s used to organize
your data assets. Users can see all catalogs on which they have been assigned the USE_CATALOG
data permission.

In Unity Catalog, admins and data stewards manage users and their access to data centrally
across all of the workspaces in a Databricks account. Users in different workspaces can
share access to the same data, depending on privileges granted centrally in Unity Catalog.

### `bricks catalogs create` - Create a catalog.

## `bricks cluster-policies` - Cluster policy limits the ability to configure clusters based on a set of rules.

Cluster policy limits the ability to configure clusters based on a set of rules. The policy
rules limit the attributes or attribute values available for cluster creation. Cluster
policies have ACLs that limit their use to specific users and groups.

Cluster policies let you limit users to create clusters with prescribed settings, simplify
the user interface and enable more users to create their own clusters (by fixing and hiding
some values), control cost by limiting per cluster maximum cost (by setting limits on
attributes whose values contribute to hourly price).

Cluster policy permissions limit which policies a user can select in the Policy drop-down
when the user creates a cluster:
- A user who has cluster create permission can select the Unrestricted policy and create
  fully-configurable clusters.
- A user who has both cluster create permission and access to cluster policies can select
  the Unrestricted policy and policies they have access to.
- A user that has access to only cluster policies, can select the policies they have access to.

If no policies have been created in the workspace, the Policy drop-down does not display.

Only admin users can create, edit, and delete policies.
Admin users also have access to all policies.

## `bricks clusters` - The Clusters API allows you to create, start, edit, list, terminate, and delete clusters.

Databricks maps cluster node instance types to compute units known as DBUs. See the instance
type pricing page for a list of the supported instance types and their corresponding DBUs.

A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations on which you run
data engineering, data science, and data analytics workloads, such as production
ETL pipelines, streaming analytics, ad-hoc analytics, and machine learning.

You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an automated job.
Databricks makes a distinction between all-purpose clusters and job clusters. You use
all-purpose clusters to analyze data collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use
job clusters to run fast and robust automated jobs.

You can create an all-purpose cluster using the UI, CLI, or commands. You can manually
terminate and restart an all-purpose cluster. Multiple users can share such clusters to do
collaborative interactive analysis.

IMPORTANT: Databricks retains cluster configuration information for up to 200 all-purpose
clusters terminated in the last 30 days and up to 30 job clusters recently terminated by
the job scheduler. To keep an all-purpose cluster configuration even after it has been
terminated for more than 30 days, an administrator can pin a cluster to the cluster list.

### `bricks clusters change-owner` - Change cluster owner.

Change the owner of the cluster. You must be an admin to perform this operation.

### `bricks clusters create` - Create new cluster.

Creates a new Spark cluster. This method will acquire new instances from the cloud provider if necessary.
This method is asynchronous; the returned `cluster_id` can be used to poll the cluster status.
When this method returns, the cluster will be in a `PENDING` state.
The cluster will be usable once it enters a `RUNNING` state.

Note: Databricks may not be able to acquire some of the requested nodes, due to cloud provider limitations
(account limits, spot price, etc.) or transient network issues.

If Databricks acquires at least 85% of the requested on-demand nodes, cluster creation will succeed.
Otherwise the cluster will terminate with an informative error message.

Flags:
 * `--no-wait` - do not wait to reach RUNNING state.
 * `--timeout` - maximum amount of time to reach RUNNING state.

## `bricks account credentials` - These commands manage credential configurations for this workspace.

Databricks needs access to a cross-account service IAM role in your AWS account so that Databricks can deploy clusters
in the appropriate VPC for the new workspace. A credential configuration encapsulates this
role information, and its ID is used when creating a new workspace.

### `bricks account credentials create` - Create credential configuration.

Creates a Databricks credential configuration that represents cloud cross-account credentials for a specified account. Databricks uses this to set up network infrastructure properly to host Databricks clusters. For your AWS IAM role, you need to trust the External ID (the Databricks Account API account ID)  in the returned credential object, and configure the required access policy.

Save the response's `credentials_id` field, which is the ID for your new credential configuration object.

## `bricks account encryption-keys` - manage encryption key configurations.

These commands manage encryption key configurations for this workspace (optional). A key
configuration encapsulates the AWS KMS key information and some information about how
the key configuration can be used. There are two possible uses for key configurations:

* Managed services: A key configuration can be used to encrypt a workspace's notebook and
secret data in the control plane, as well as Databricks SQL queries and query history.
* Storage: A key configuration can be used to encrypt a workspace's DBFS and EBS data in
the data plane.

In both of these cases, the key configuration's ID is used when creating a new workspace.
This Preview feature is available if your account is on the E2 version of the platform.
Updating a running workspace with workspace storage encryption requires that the workspace
is on the E2 version of the platform. If you have an older workspace, it might not be on
the E2 version of the platform. If you are not sure, contact your Databricks representative.

### `bricks account encryption-keys create` - Create encryption key configuration.

Creates a customer-managed key configuration object for an account, specified by ID. This operation uploads a reference to a customer-managed key to Databricks.

If it is specified as a workspace's customer-managed key for workspace storage, the key encrypts the workspace's root S3 bucket (which contains the workspace's root DBFS and system data) and, optionally, cluster EBS volume data.

**Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment types, subscription types, and AWS regions.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body

If assigned as a workspace's customer-managed key for managed services, Databricks uses the key to encrypt the workspaces notebooks and secrets in the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries and query history. If it is specified as a workspace's customer-managed key for storage, the key encrypts the workspace's root S3 bucket (which contains the workspace's root DBFS and system data) and, optionally, cluster EBS volume data.

**Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment types, subscription types, and AWS regions.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform.

### `bricks account encryption-keys list` - Get all encryption key configurations.

Gets all customer-managed key configuration objects for an account. If the key is specified as a workspace's managed services customer-managed key, Databricks uses the key to encrypt the workspace's notebooks and secrets in the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries and query history. If the key is specified as a workspace's storage customer-managed key, the key is used to encrypt the workspace's root S3 bucket and optionally can encrypt cluster EBS volumes data in the data plane.

**Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment types, subscription types, and AWS regions.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform.

 * `--run-uuid` - [Deprecated, use run_id instead] ID of the run from which to fetch metric values.

### `bricks experiments get-run` - Get a run.

Gets the metadata, metrics, params, and tags for a run.
In the case where multiple metrics with the same key are logged for a run, return only the value
with the latest timestamp.

If there are multiple values with the latest timestamp, return the maximum of these values.

Flags:

### `bricks experiments log-batch` - Log a batch.

Logs a batch of metrics, params, and tags for a run.
If any data failed to be persisted, the server will respond with an error (non-200 status code).

In case of error (due to internal server error or an invalid request), partial data may be written.

You can write metrics, params, and tags in interleaving fashion, but within a given entity type are guaranteed to follow
the order specified in the request body.

The overwrite behavior for metrics,  params, and tags is as follows:

* Metrics: metric values are never overwritten.
  Logging a metric (key, value, timestamp) appends to the set of values for the metric with the provided key.

* Tags: tag values can be overwritten by successive writes to the same tag key.
  That is, if multiple tag values with the same key are provided in the same API request,
  the last-provided tag value is written. Logging the same tag (key, value) is permitted. Specifically, logging a tag is idempotent.

* Parameters: once written, param values cannot be changed (attempting to overwrite a param value will result in an error).
  However, logging the same param (key, value) is permitted. Specifically, logging a param is idempotent.

  Request Limits
  -------------------------------
  A single JSON-serialized API request may be up to 1 MB in size and contain:

 * No more than 1000 metrics,  params, and tags in total
 * Up to 1000 metrics - Up to 100  params
 * Up to 100 tags

 For example, a valid request might contain 900 metrics, 50 params, and 50 tags, but logging 900 metrics, 50 params,
 and 51 tags is invalid.

 The following limits also apply to metric, param, and tag keys and values:

 * Metric keyes, param keys, and tag keys can be up to 250 characters in length
 * Parameter and tag values can be up to 250 characters in length

## `bricks external-locations` - manage cloud storage path with a storage credential that authorizes access to it.

An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with a storage
credential that authorizes access to the cloud storage path. Each external location is
subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that control which users and groups can
access the credential. If a user does not have access to an external location in Unity
Catalog, the request fails and Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud
tenant on the userâ€™s behalf.

Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage credentials
directly.

To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user with the
**CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.

## `bricks global-init-scripts` - configure global initialization scripts for the workspace.

The Global Init Scripts API enables Workspace administrators to configure global
initialization scripts for their workspace. These scripts run on every node in every cluster
in the workspace.

**Important:** Existing clusters must be restarted to pick up any changes made to global
init scripts.
Global init scripts are run in order. If the init script returns with a bad exit code,
the Apache Spark container fails to launch and init scripts with later position are skipped.
If enough containers fail, the entire cluster fails with a `GLOBAL_INIT_SCRIPT_FAILURE`
error code.

### `bricks global-init-scripts create` - Create init script.

Creates a new global init script in this workspace.
Flags:
 * `--enabled` - Specifies whether the script is enabled.

## `bricks grants` - Manage data access in Unity Catalog.

In Unity Catalog, data is secure by default. Initially, users have no access to data in
a metastore. Access can be granted by either a metastore admin, the owner of an object, or
the owner of the catalog or schema that contains the object. Securable objects in Unity
Catalog are hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.

Securable objects in Unity Catalog are hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.
This means that granting a privilege on the catalog automatically grants the privilege to
all current and future objects within the catalog. Similarly, privileges granted on a schema
are inherited by all current and future objects within that schema.

## `bricks instance-pools` - manage ready-to-use cloud instances which reduces a cluster start and auto-scaling times.

Instance Pools API are used to create, edit, delete and list instance pools by using
ready-to-use cloud instances which reduces a cluster start and auto-scaling times.

Databricks pools reduce cluster start and auto-scaling times by maintaining a set of idle,
ready-to-use instances. When a cluster is attached to a pool, cluster nodes are created using
the poolâ€™s idle instances. If the pool has no idle instances, the pool expands by allocating
a new instance from the instance provider in order to accommodate the clusterâ€™s request.
When a cluster releases an instance, it returns to the pool and is free for another cluster
to use. Only clusters attached to a pool can use that poolâ€™s idle instances.

You can specify a different pool for the driver node and worker nodes, or use the same pool
for both.

Databricks does not charge DBUs while instances are idle in the pool. Instance provider
billing does apply. See pricing.

## `bricks ip-access-lists` - enable admins to configure IP access lists.

IP Access List enables admins to configure IP access lists.

IP access lists affect web application access and commands access to this workspace only.
If the feature is disabled for a workspace, all access is allowed for this workspace.
There is support for allow lists (inclusion) and block lists (exclusion).

When a connection is attempted:
  1. **First, all block lists are checked.** If the connection IP address matches any block list, the connection is rejected.
  2. **If the connection was not rejected by block lists**, the IP address is compared with the allow lists.

If there is at least one allow list for the workspace, the connection is allowed only if the IP address matches an allow list.
If there are no allow lists for the workspace, all IP addresses are allowed.

For all allow lists and block lists combined, the workspace supports a maximum of 1000 IP/CIDR values, where one CIDR counts as a single value.

After changes to the IP access list feature, it can take a few minutes for changes to take effect.

### `bricks ip-access-lists create` - Create access list.

  where one CIDR counts as a single value. Attempts to exceed that number return error 400 with `error_code` value `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`.
  * If the new list would block the calling user's current IP, error 400 is returned with `error_code` value `INVALID_STATE`.

It can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.
**Note**: Your new IP access list has no effect until you enable the feature. See :method:workspaceconf/setStatus

access to the account console.

Account IP Access Lists affect web application access and commands access to the account
console and account APIs. If the feature is disabled for the account, all access is allowed
for this account. There is support for allow lists (inclusion) and block lists (exclusion).

When a connection is attempted:
  1. **First, all block lists are checked.** If the connection IP address matches any block
  list, the connection is rejected.
  2. **If the connection was not rejected by block lists**, the IP address is compared with
  the allow lists.

If there is at least one allow list for the account, the connection is allowed only if the
IP address matches an allow list. If there are no allow lists for the account, all IP

## `bricks libraries` - Manage libraries on a cluster.

The Libraries API allows you to install and uninstall libraries and get the status of
libraries on a cluster.

To make third-party or custom code available to notebooks and jobs running on your clusters,
you can install a library. Libraries can be written in Python, Java, Scala, and R. You can
upload Java, Scala, and Python libraries and point to external packages in PyPI, Maven, and
CRAN repositories.

Cluster libraries can be used by all notebooks running on a cluster. You can install a cluster
library directly from a public repository such as PyPI or Maven, using a previously installed
workspace library, or using an init script.

When you install a library on a cluster, a notebook already attached to that cluster will not
immediately see the new library. You must first detach and then reattach the notebook to
the cluster.

When you uninstall a library from a cluster, the library is removed only when you restart
the cluster. Until you restart the cluster, the status of the uninstalled library appears
as Uninstall pending restart.

### `bricks libraries all-cluster-statuses` - Get all statuses.

via the API or the libraries UI as well as libraries set to be installed on all clusters via the libraries UI.

### `bricks libraries cluster-status` - Get status.

Get the status of libraries on a cluster. A status will be available for all libraries installed on this cluster via the API
or the libraries UI as well as libraries set to be installed on all clusters via the libraries UI.
The order of returned libraries will be as follows.

1. Libraries set to be installed on this cluster will be returned first.
  Within this group, the final order will be order in which the libraries were added to the cluster.

2. Libraries set to be installed on all clusters are returned next.
  Within this group there is no order guarantee.

3. Libraries that were previously requested on this cluster or on all clusters, but now marked for removal.
  Within this group there is no order guarantee.

### `bricks libraries install` - Add a library.

Add libraries to be installed on a cluster.
The installation is asynchronous; it happens in the background after the completion of this request.

**Note**: The actual set of libraries to be installed on a cluster is the union of the libraries specified via this method and
the libraries set to be installed on all clusters via the libraries UI.

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body

### `bricks libraries uninstall` - Uninstall libraries.

Set libraries to be uninstalled on a cluster. The libraries won't be uninstalled until the cluster is restarted.
Uninstalling libraries that are not installed on the cluster will have no impact but is not an error.

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body

## `bricks account log-delivery` - These commands manage log delivery configurations for this account.

These commands manage log delivery configurations for this account. The two supported log types
for command are _billable usage logs_ and _audit logs_. This feature is in Public Preview.
This feature works with all account ID types.

Log delivery works with all account types. However, if your account is on the E2 version of
the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account, you can
optionally configure different storage destinations for each workspace. Log delivery status
is also provided to know the latest status of log delivery attempts.
The high-level flow of billable usage delivery:

1. **Create storage**: In AWS, [create a new AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/aws-storage.html)
with a specific bucket policy. Using Databricks APIs, call the Account API to create a [storage configuration object](#operation/create-storage-config)
that uses the bucket name.
2. **Create credentials**: In AWS, create the appropriate AWS IAM role. For full details,
including the required IAM role policies and trust relationship, see
[Billable usage log delivery](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/billable-usage-delivery.html).
Using Databricks APIs, call the Account API to create a [credential configuration object](#operation/create-credential-config)
that uses the IAM role's ARN.
3. **Create log delivery configuration**: Using Databricks APIs, call the Account API to
[create a log delivery configuration](#operation/create-log-delivery-config) that uses
the credential and storage configuration objects from previous steps. You can specify if
the logs should include all events of that log type in your account (_Account level_ delivery)
or only events for a specific set of workspaces (_workspace level_ delivery). Account level
log delivery applies to all current and future workspaces plus account level logs, while
workspace level log delivery solely delivers logs related to the specified workspaces.
You can create multiple types of delivery configurations per account.

For billable usage delivery:
* For more information about billable usage logs, see
[Billable usage log delivery](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/billable-usage-delivery.html).
For the CSV schema, see the [Usage page](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/usage.html).
* The delivery location is `<bucket-name>/<prefix>/billable-usage/csv/`, where `<prefix>` is
the name of the optional delivery path prefix you set up during log delivery configuration.
Files are named `workspaceId=<workspace-id>-usageMonth=<month>.csv`.
* All billable usage logs apply to specific workspaces (_workspace level_ logs). You can
aggregate usage for your entire account by creating an _account level_ delivery
configuration that delivers logs for all current and future workspaces in your account.
* The files are delivered daily by overwriting the month's CSV file for each workspace.

For audit log delivery:
* For more information about about audit log delivery, see
[Audit log delivery](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html),
which includes information about the used JSON schema.
* The delivery location is `<bucket-name>/<delivery-path-prefix>/workspaceId=<workspaceId>/date=<yyyy-mm-dd>/auditlogs_<internal-id>.json`.
Files may get overwritten with the same content multiple times to achieve exactly-once delivery.
* If the audit log delivery configuration included specific workspace IDs, only
_workspace-level_ audit logs for those workspaces are delivered. If the log delivery
configuration applies to the entire account (_account level_ delivery configuration),
the audit log delivery includes workspace-level audit logs for all workspaces in the account
as well as account-level audit logs. See
[Audit log delivery](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html) for details.
* Auditable events are typically available in logs within 15 minutes.

### `bricks account log-delivery create` - Create a new log delivery configuration.

Creates a new Databricks log delivery configuration to enable delivery of the specified type of logs to your storage location. This requires that you already created a [credential object](#operation/create-credential-config) (which encapsulates a cross-account service IAM role) and a [storage configuration object](#operation/create-storage-config) (which encapsulates an S3 bucket).

For full details, including the required IAM role policies and bucket policies, see [Deliver and access billable usage logs](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/billable-usage-delivery.html) or [Configure audit logging](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html).

**Note**: There is a limit on the number of log delivery configurations available per account (each limit applies separately to each log type including billable usage and audit logs). You can create a maximum of two enabled account-level delivery configurations (configurations without a workspace filter) per type. Additionally, you can create two enabled workspace-level delivery configurations per workspace for each log type, which means that the same workspace ID can occur in the workspace filter for no more than two delivery configurations per log type.

You cannot delete a log delivery configuration, but you can disable it (see [Enable or disable log delivery configuration](#operation/patch-log-delivery-config-status)).

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body

### `bricks account log-delivery get` - Get log delivery configuration.

### `bricks account log-delivery patch-status` - Enable or disable log delivery configuration.

Enables or disables a log delivery configuration. Deletion of delivery configurations is not supported, so disable log delivery configurations that are no longer needed. Note that you can't re-enable a delivery configuration if this would violate the delivery configuration limits described under [Create log delivery](#operation/create-log-delivery-config).

use each metastore. For a workspace to use Unity Catalog, it must have a Unity Catalog
metastore attached.

Each metastore is configured with a root storage location in a cloud storage account.
This storage location is used for metadata and managed tables data.

PrivateLink, a workspace must have a private access settings object referenced
by ID in the workspace's `private_access_settings_id` property.

You can share one private access settings with multiple workspaces in a single account. However,
private access settings are specific to AWS regions, so only workspaces in the same
AWS region can use a given private access settings object.

Before configuring PrivateLink, read the
[Databricks article about PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html).

This operation completely overwrites your existing private access settings object attached to your workspaces.
All workspaces attached to the private access settings are affected by any change.
If `public_access_enabled`, `private_access_level`, or `allowed_vpc_endpoint_ids`
are updated, effects of these changes might take several minutes to propagate to the
workspace API.

You can share one private access settings object with multiple
workspaces in a single account. However, private access settings are specific to
AWS regions, so only workspaces in the same AWS region can use a given private access
settings object.

Before configuring PrivateLink, read the
[Databricks article about PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html).

Flags:
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body

Instead of directly entering your credentials into a notebook, use Databricks secrets to store
your credentials and reference them in notebooks and jobs.

Administrators, secret creators, and users granted permission can read Databricks secrets.
While Databricks makes an effort to redact secret values that might be displayed in notebooks,
it is not possible to prevent such users from reading secrets.

and permissions are ordered as follows:

* `MANAGE` - Allowed to change ACLs, and read and write to this secret scope.
* `WRITE` - Allowed to read and write to this secret scope.
* `READ` - Allowed to read this secret scope and list what secrets are available.

Note that in general, secret values can only be read from within a command on a cluster (for example, through a notebook).
There is no API to read the actual secret value material outside of a cluster.
However, the user's permission will be applied based on who is executing the command, and they must have at least READ permission.

Users must have the `MANAGE` permission to invoke command.

The principal is a user or group name corresponding to an existing Databricks principal to be granted or revoked access.

## `bricks serving-endpoints` - Manage model serving endpoints.

The Serving Endpoints API allows you to create, update, and delete model serving endpoints.

You can use a serving endpoint to serve models from the Databricks Model Registry. Endpoints expose
the underlying models as scalable commands endpoints using serverless compute. This means
the endpoints and associated compute resources are fully managed by Databricks and will not appear in
your cloud account. A serving endpoint can consist of one or more MLflow models from the Databricks
Model Registry, called served models. A serving endpoint can have at most ten served models. You can configure
traffic settings to define how requests should be routed to your served models behind an endpoint.
Additionally, you can configure the scale of resources that should be applied to each served model.

### `bricks serving-endpoints build-logs` - Retrieve the logs associated with building the model's environment for a given serving endpoint's served model.

The caller must be the owner of the share or a metastore admin.

When the caller is a metastore admin, only the __owner__ field can be updated.

In the case that the share name is changed, **updateShare** requires that the caller is both the share owner and
a metastore admin.

For each table that is added through this method, the share owner must also have **SELECT** privilege on the table.
This privilege must be maintained indefinitely for recipients to be able to access the table.
Typically, you should use a group as the share owner.

Table removals through **update** do not require additional privileges.

## `bricks account storage` - Manage storage configurations for this workspace.

These commands manage storage configurations for this workspace. A root storage S3 bucket in
your account is required to store objects like cluster logs, notebook revisions, and job
results. You can also use the root storage S3 bucket for storage of non-production DBFS
data. A storage configuration encapsulates this bucket information, and its ID is used when
creating a new workspace.

### `bricks account storage create` - Create new storage configuration.

Creates new storage configuration for an account, specified by ID. Uploads a storage configuration object that represents the root AWS S3 bucket in your account. Databricks stores related workspace assets including DBFS, cluster logs, and job results. For the AWS S3 bucket, you need to configure the required bucket policy.

For information about how to create a new workspace with command, see [Create a new workspace using the Account API](http://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/new-workspace.html)

## `bricks storage-credentials` - Manage storage credentials for Unity Catalog.

A storage credential represents an authentication and authorization mechanism for accessing
data stored on your cloud tenant. Each storage credential is subject to
Unity Catalog access-control policies that control which users and groups can access
the credential. If a user does not have access to a storage credential in Unity Catalog,
the request fails and Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant
on the userâ€™s behalf.

Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage credentials
directly.

To create storage credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin. The account admin
who creates the storage credential can delegate ownership to another user or group to
manage permissions on it.

### `bricks storage-credentials create` - Create a storage credential.

## `bricks table-constraints` - Primary key and foreign key constraints encode relationships between fields in tables.

Primary and foreign keys are informational only and are not enforced. Foreign keys must reference a primary key in another table.
This primary key is the parent constraint of the foreign key and the table this primary key is on is the parent table of the foreign key.
Similarly, the foreign key is the child constraint of its referenced primary key; the table of the foreign key is the child table of the primary key.

You can declare primary keys and foreign keys as part of the table specification during table creation.
You can also add or drop constraints on existing tables.

## `bricks account workspaces` - These commands manage workspaces for this account.

These commands manage workspaces for this account. A Databricks workspace is an environment for
accessing all of your Databricks assets. The workspace organizes objects (notebooks,
libraries, and experiments) into folders, and provides access to data and computational
resources such as clusters and jobs.

These endpoints are available if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on
a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

### `bricks account workspaces create` - Create a new workspace.

Creates a new workspace.

**Important**: This operation is asynchronous. A response with HTTP status code 200 means
the request has been accepted and is in progress, but does not mean that the workspace
deployed successfully and is running. The initial workspace status is typically
`PROVISIONING`. Use the workspace ID (`workspace_id`) field in the response to identify
the new workspace and make repeated `GET` requests with the workspace ID and check
its status. The workspace becomes available when the status changes to `RUNNING`.

Flags:
 * `--no-wait` - do not wait to reach RUNNING state.
 * `--timeout` - maximum amount of time to reach RUNNING state.
 * `--json` - either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body
 * `--aws-region` - The AWS region of the workspace's data plane.
 * `--cloud` - The cloud provider which the workspace uses.
 * `--credentials-id` - ID of the workspace's credential configuration object.
 * `--deployment-name` - The deployment name defines part of the subdomain for the workspace.
 * `--location` - The Google Cloud region of the workspace data plane in your Google account.
 * `--managed-services-customer-managed-key-id` - The ID of the workspace's managed services encryption key configuration object.
 * `--network-id` -
 * `--pricing-tier` - The pricing tier of the workspace.
 * `--private-access-settings-id` - ID of the workspace's private access settings object.
 * `--storage-configuration-id` - The ID of the workspace's storage configuration object.
 * `--storage-customer-managed-key-id` - The ID of the workspace's storage encryption key configuration object.

### `bricks account workspaces delete` - Delete a workspace.

Terminates and deletes a Databricks workspace. From an API perspective, deletion is immediate. However, it might take a few minutes for all workspaces resources to be deleted, depending on the size and number of workspace resources.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

### `bricks account workspaces get` - Get a workspace.

Gets information including status for a Databricks workspace, specified by ID. In the response, the `workspace_status` field indicates the current status. After initial workspace creation (which is asynchronous), make repeated `GET` requests with the workspace ID and check its status. The workspace becomes available when the status changes to `RUNNING`.

For information about how to create a new workspace with command **including error handling**, see [Create a new workspace using the Account API](http://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/new-workspace.html).

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

### `bricks account workspaces list` - Get all workspaces.

Gets a list of all workspaces associated with an account, specified by ID.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

### `bricks account workspaces update` - Update workspace configuration.

Updates a workspace configuration for either a running workspace or a failed workspace. The elements that can be updated varies between these two use cases.

Update a failed workspace:
You can update a Databricks workspace configuration for failed workspace deployment for some fields, but not all fields. For a failed workspace, this request supports updates to the following fields only:
- Credential configuration ID
- Storage configuration ID
- Network configuration ID. Used only to add or change a network configuration for a customer-managed VPC. For a failed workspace only, you can convert a workspace with Databricks-managed VPC to use a customer-managed VPC by adding this ID. You cannot downgrade a workspace with a customer-managed VPC to be a Databricks-managed VPC. You can update the network configuration for a failed or running workspace to add PrivateLink support, though you must also add a private access settings object.
- Key configuration ID for managed services (control plane storage, such as notebook source and Databricks SQL queries). Used only if you use customer-managed keys for managed services.
- Key configuration ID for workspace storage (root S3 bucket and, optionally, EBS volumes). Used only if you use customer-managed keys for workspace storage. **Important**: If the workspace was ever in the running state, even if briefly before becoming a failed workspace, you cannot add a new key configuration ID for workspace storage.
- Private access settings ID to add PrivateLink support. You can add or update the private access settings ID to upgrade a workspace to add support for front-end, back-end, or both types of connectivity. You cannot remove (downgrade) any existing front-end or back-end PrivateLink support on a workspace.

After calling the `PATCH` operation to update the workspace configuration, make repeated `GET` requests with the workspace ID and check the workspace status. The workspace is successful if the status changes to `RUNNING`.

For information about how to create a new workspace with command **including error handling**, see [Create a new workspace using the Account API](http://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/new-workspace.html).

Update a running workspace:
You can update a Databricks workspace configuration for running workspaces for some fields, but not all fields. For a running workspace, this request supports updating the following fields only:
- Credential configuration ID

- Network configuration ID. Used only if you already use a customer-managed VPC. You cannot convert a running workspace from a Databricks-managed VPC to a customer-managed VPC. You can use a network configuration update in command for a failed or running workspace to add support for PrivateLink, although you also need to add a private access settings object.

- Key configuration ID for managed services (control plane storage, such as notebook source and Databricks SQL queries). Databricks does not directly encrypt the data with the customer-managed key (CMK). Databricks uses both the CMK and the Databricks managed key (DMK) that is unique to your workspace to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK). Databricks uses the DEK to encrypt your workspace's managed services persisted data. If the workspace does not already have a CMK for managed services, adding this ID enables managed services encryption for new or updated data. Existing managed services data that existed before adding the key remains not encrypted with the DEK until it is modified. If the workspace already has customer-managed keys for managed services, this request rotates (changes) the CMK keys and the DEK is re-encrypted with the DMK and the new CMK.
- Key configuration ID for workspace storage (root S3 bucket and, optionally, EBS volumes). You can set this only if the workspace does not already have a customer-managed key configuration for workspace storage.
- Private access settings ID to add PrivateLink support. You can add or update the private access settings ID to upgrade a workspace to add support for front-end, back-end, or both types of connectivity. You cannot remove (downgrade) any existing front-end or back-end PrivateLink support on a workspace.

**Important**: To update a running workspace, your workspace must have no running compute resources that run in your workspace's VPC in the Classic data plane. For example, stop all all-purpose clusters, job clusters, pools with running clusters, and Classic SQL warehouses. If you do not terminate all cluster instances in the workspace before calling command, the request will fail.

**Important**: Customer-managed keys and customer-managed VPCs are supported by only some deployment types and subscription types. If you have questions about availability, contact your Databricks representative.

This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.
